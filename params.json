{"name":"Miss-Alt","tagline":"","body":"![Logo of Miss-Alt project, which is a grandmother called Miss Alt](https://raw.github.com/willynilly/miss-alt/master/static/missalt.png)\r\n### Miss-Alt\r\n\r\nMiss-Alt will allow people with disabilities and their advocates to report missing, insufficient, or inaccurate alternative text for images anywhere on the web.  Universities, companies, nonprofits, and government agencies will be able to search Miss-Alt to discover problematic alternative text for their images, and prioritize improvements requested by their users who have disabilities.  It's currently under development and not yet deployed on a live site, but you can deploy a working version of the site on your computer if you like.  It's all open-source.  And I'm open to suggestions on how to improve it... as well as any help building the tiny web service.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor: Will Riley (@willynilly)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
